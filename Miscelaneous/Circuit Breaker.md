The **Circuit Breaker Design Pattern** is a software design approach used to increase the resilience and stability of distributed systems, especially when communicating with external services or APIs. It prevents the system from continuously retrying requests to a failing service, which could lead to further performance degradation or system-wide failures.

### How It Works
The Circuit Breaker has three main states:
1. **Closed**:
   - The system functions normally, allowing requests to the external service.
   - If a certain number of failures (based on thresholds) occur, the circuit switches to the **Open** state.

2. **Open**:
   - Requests are automatically blocked (or fail immediately) without attempting to contact the external service.
   - The system periodically checks if the service is back online (transitioning to Half-Open).

3. **Half-Open**:
   - A limited number of test requests are allowed to pass through to the external service.
   - If the requests succeed, the circuit transitions back to **Closed**.
   - If the requests fail, the circuit remains in **Open**.

### Why Use Circuit Breaker?
- **Prevent System Overload**: Stops a cascading failure caused by repeated attempts to a failing service.
- **Improve User Experience**: Returns a fallback response immediately instead of long delays.
- **Enable Self-Healing**: Checks if the external service recovers without causing additional stress.

### Implementation Example
1. **Client Requests a Service**:
   - If the service is healthy, the request is processed normally.
   - If a failure occurs (e.g., timeout, server error), the Circuit Breaker records the failure.

2. **Failure Threshold Reached**:
   - The Circuit Breaker trips to **Open**, and all subsequent requests fail quickly.

3. **Recovery Attempt**:
   - After a timeout period, the Circuit Breaker moves to **Half-Open** to test if the service is back online.

4. **Service Status**:
   - If successful, the Circuit Breaker resets to **Closed**.
   - If it fails again, it returns to **Open**.
