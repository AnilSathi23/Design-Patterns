**JWT**, or **JSON Web Token**, is a compact and secure way to represent information between two parties, such as a client and a server. It is widely used in authentication and authorization mechanisms in modern web applications.

A JWT consists of three parts:
1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, including the type of token (`JWT`) and the signing algorithm (e.g., `HS256`).
2. **Payload**: Contains the actual data being transferred, such as user information (e.g., user ID, roles, permissions) or other claims. This data is **not encrypted** but is encoded, so it can be easily read if decoded.
3. **Signature**: A cryptographic signature that ensures the token's integrity. It’s created by signing the header and payload with a secret key or a public/private key pair.

The three parts are concatenated with dots (.) to form the final JWT, which looks like this:

### How JWT Works in Authentication:
1. A user logs in by providing credentials.
2. The server verifies the credentials and generates a JWT.
3. The JWT is sent to the client, which stores it (e.g., in a cookie or localStorage).
4. For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the **Authorization header**.
5. The server validates the token and provides access based on its claims.

**Advantages of JWT:**
- **Stateless**: Since the token itself carries the user’s information, the server doesn’t need to store session data.
- **Portable**: The same JWT can be used across multiple systems.
- **Scalable**: Ideal for distributed systems and microservices.

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are versatile and have a wide range of applications, especially in the context of authentication and secure data exchange. Here are some common use cases:

### 1. **User Authentication**
   - JWTs are widely used for **stateless authentication** in web and mobile applications.
   - After logging in, the server generates a JWT that includes user information, and the client uses this token for subsequent requests to access protected resources.

### 2. **Authorization**
   - Based on the claims in the JWT, servers can decide whether the user has the right permissions to access specific resources.
   - For example, a token might include roles like `admin` or `user`, and the backend can grant or deny access accordingly.

### 3. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
   - JWTs enable **SSO systems**, allowing users to log in once and access multiple applications without needing to authenticate separately for each.
   - This works because JWTs are portable and can be shared securely between services.

### 4. **Data Exchange Between Services (Microservices)**
   - In distributed systems, JWTs allow secure communication between microservices.
   - A service can include a JWT in its requests to another service, ensuring that the request is authenticated and authorized.

### 5. **API Authentication**
   - APIs often require authentication for access. Clients can send a JWT in the `Authorization` header of API requests to verify their identity and permissions.

### 6. **Session Management**
   - In stateless systems, JWTs replace traditional session storage by including all session information in the token itself.
   - This makes it easier to scale systems without needing centralized session storage.

### 7. **Mobile App Authentication**
   - JWTs are commonly used in mobile applications to authenticate users and maintain their sessions efficiently.

### 8. **Temporary Secure Links**
   - JWTs are used to generate secure links for one-time access, such as password reset links or email verification links. The token includes an expiration time to ensure security.

### 9. **Event-Based Systems**
   - In systems that rely on event-driven communication (e.g., WebSocket-based apps), JWTs can authenticate and validate event messages.

JWTs' self-contained nature and portability make them ideal for these use cases.
