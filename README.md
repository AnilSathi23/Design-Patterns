1) ABSTRACTION

In this case we can use Abstraction of and Engine to compose abstraciton of a car.

2) ENCAPSULATION
Is all about hiding information. Here is the idea is to protect the applicaiton from one part of the application from other part. So in this case if you have to change one part you dont have to change the other part too.

For lot of people encapsulation is to set the member variables as private and provide setter and getter to control access to these variables.

Encapsulation can also seperate behaviour from other parts of the application
